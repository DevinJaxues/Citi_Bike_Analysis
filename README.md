## Summary ##
---

In summary, we can adress 3 main situations based off the data. User and Subscriber data shows that 66% is male. This could be used to help in advertisement. Secondly, most bikes get used on the west end of the city. Repairs could focus their efforts there to prevent overuse and rotation of new to old bikes. And lastly, when the bikes are being used.
