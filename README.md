## Overview of Citi Bike Visualizations ##

<sub>In this analysis our purpose was to take a data set and answer questions using visualizations. When it came to the Citi Bike data, we looked into gender, location, membership and useage indicators. To tell a story using Tableau.</sub>

- 2.Next, we needed to clean that table due to duplicates of employees who have switched positions over the years.

- 3.Next, we cleaned the data even more into a title specific list so management can see at a glance what departments will be hit the hardest.

- 4.Lastly, the company wants to start a mentorship program. So we made a table of employees born in 1965 and ordered them by employee number.

## Summary ##
---
- 1.After finding our retiring employees by department. A sum of the counts brought us to a total of 90398 employees due to retire.
- 2.Based off of our retiring_titles table we can see that the Senior positions will be well taken care of if we can receive a 10% mentorship rate. However with that same rate on the management and tech positions, then they will not be as well trained. I would break this down more into a table based of departmens and a table for positions specific grouped by department. Hoever I am away from my workstation and dont have access to PGadmin.
